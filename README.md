Portfolio 10 for Phase 2 of DevBootcamp

I took this opportunity to map out some of the photos I took while I was abroad from August 2013 to March 2014.


Next steps:
Use Ajax request to send album data and photo data to JavaScript
Redo path and photos with Ajax requests
Map photo markers to all photos in an album
Use a random photo as the collective marker for the entire album
